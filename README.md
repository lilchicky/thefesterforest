Chicky's Fester Forest mod

Yes the main folder is called Test Mod, i can't be bothered to change it 
and this whole mod started as my first ever test mod.

This mod adds a new dimension that I aim to make a sort of looter-shooter
style. Mobs and chests will have a bunch of different items, ranging from memey
to strong to use. There will be loads of structures, and different tiers of mobs -
from regular old ones to bosses found only in certain structures. 

The focus of this all is to create a fun assortment of post-vanilla items to create
the loadout of your dreams, in any modpack.
